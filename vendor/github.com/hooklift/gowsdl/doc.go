WSDL to Go

Generates Go code from a WSDL file. This project is originally intended to generate Go clients for WS-* services.

Features

  * Supports only Document/Literal wrapped services, which are [WS-I](http://ws-i.org/) compliant
  * Attempts to generate idiomatic Go code as much as possible
  * Generates Go code in parallel: types, operations and soap proxy
  * Supports:
	  * WSDL 1.1
	  * XML Schema 1.0
	  * SOAP 1.1
  * Resolves external XML Schemas recursively, up to 5 recursions.
  * Supports providing WSDL HTTP URL as well as a local WSDL file

Not supported

  * Setting SOAP headers
  * SOAP 1.2 and HTTP port bindings
  * WS-Security

Usage

  gowsdl [OPTIONS]

  Application Options:
	  -v, --version     Shows gowsdl version
	  -p, --package=    Package under which code will be generated (myservice)
	  -o, --output=     File where the generated code will be saved (myservice.go)
	  -i, --ignore-tls  Ignores invalid TLS certificates. It is not recomended for production. Use at your own risk
										(false)

  Help Options:
	  -h, --help        Show this help message

TODO

  * Add support for filters to allow the user to change the generated code
  * If WSDL file is local, resolve external XML schemas locally too instead of failing due to not having a URL to download them from.
  * Resolve XSD element references
  * Support for generating namespaces
  * Make code generation agnostic so generating code to other programming languages is feasible through plugins
